#Required packages:
Use pip3 > freeze requirements.txt to add packages that have been installed in current environment to a file called requirements.txt (some are redundant, so probably best to use install in an environment... to not install on your actual machine)
use pip install -r requirements.txt to install all packages in requirements.txt

#Set up virtualenv:
- pip3 install virtualenv
- virtualenv env
- source env/bin/activate
- pip3 install -r requirements.txt

#How to run:
python3 run.py in parent directory (coursework)
